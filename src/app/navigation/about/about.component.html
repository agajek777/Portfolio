      <p>
        After reading about my hobbies and ways of spending free time on the home page - it is time to talk about my education and work experience.
        Since 2017 I'm actively coding and discovering new technologies. In 2018 I became a CS Student at <strong> Warsaw School of Computer Science (WWSI)</strong>.
        January 2020 I started my first "IT work" as a <strong>Junior C++ Developer in Accenture</strong>. I maitain and develope billing system and I am responsible for
        coding and testing of new functionalities.

      <h2>💻👨‍💻</h2>
      <p>
        I started gaining coding skills from learning <strong>C++</strong>. I was writing console programms, I got to know essential algorithms written in this language and I practiced my
        algorithm skills on polish version of <a href="https://pl.spoj.com/" target="_blank">Spoj.com</a>. Since object-oriented programming wasn't a problem for me -
        I started learning <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>.NET Core</strong>. That's how my interest to web-developing started. I went from web apps fully developed in .NET
        platform (MVC, EntityFramework, .Net Identity, Razor Pages, SignalR), to the Angular 9 apps with .NET Web APIs back-end. Currently I mainly work on web programming skills
        and I write new projects to expand my qualifications.
